# Qwen Code Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality Standards
All code must adhere to established quality standards with comprehensive linting, formatting, and static analysis. Code reviews are mandatory for all changes, with specific focus on maintainability, readability, and adherence to language-specific best practices.

### II. Comprehensive Testing
Every feature must be accompanied by a comprehensive test suite including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests where applicable. Test coverage must meet minimum thresholds, and all tests must pass before code can be merged.

### III. User Experience Consistency
All user interfaces and interactions must maintain consistent design patterns, behaviors, and standards. User experience must be predictable, accessible, and aligned with established design guidelines across all touchpoints.

### IV. Performance Requirements
All features must meet defined performance benchmarks including response times, memory usage, and scalability requirements. Performance testing is mandatory for features that could impact system performance.

### V. Security & Compliance
Security is a primary concern in all development activities. All code must follow security best practices, undergo security reviews, and comply with relevant regulations and standards.

## Development Standards
All development must follow established coding standards, use approved technologies and frameworks, and maintain comprehensive documentation. Code must be modular, reusable, and well-structured with clear separation of concerns.

## Quality Assurance Process
All code changes must go through a rigorous quality assurance process including automated testing, code review, security scanning, and performance validation. Only changes that pass all quality gates may be deployed to production.

## Governance
This constitution supersedes all other development practices and guidelines. All team members must adhere to these principles. Amendments require documentation, community review, and approval from project maintainers. Compliance is verified during code reviews and automated checks.
