# MCP Server Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Security & Access Control
All file system operations must be performed within strict security boundaries with comprehensive access controls. File browsing operations must be sandboxed, and permissions must be explicitly granted and validated for each operation. All interactions with the file system must be audited and logged for security review.

### II. Performance & Responsiveness
File browsing and search operations must be optimized for low latency and high throughput. The server must efficiently handle concurrent requests and implement appropriate caching mechanisms. Response times for file operations must meet defined performance benchmarks.

### III. Reliability & Fault Tolerance
The server must handle file system errors gracefully with comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms. All operations must include proper exception handling, and the system must be resilient to file system inconsistencies, permission errors, and other common issues.

### IV. Compatibility & Interoperability
The server must support various file systems, operating systems, and file formats. Cross-platform compatibility is essential, and the server must handle different file encoding, line endings, and metadata formats appropriately.

### V. Privacy & Data Protection
User data privacy is paramount. The server must implement proper data handling practices, ensure no unauthorized data access, and comply with relevant privacy regulations. File content must never be stored or transmitted without explicit user consent.

## Development Standards
All development must follow established coding standards, use approved technologies and frameworks, and maintain comprehensive documentation. Code must be modular, reusable, and well-structured with clear separation of concerns, particularly regarding security-sensitive operations.

## Quality Assurance Process
All code changes must go through a rigorous quality assurance process including security reviews, performance testing, and cross-platform compatibility validation. Only changes that pass all quality gates may be deployed to production.

## Governance
This constitution supersedes all other development practices and guidelines. All team members must adhere to these principles. Amendments require documentation, community review, and approval from project maintainers. Compliance is verified during code reviews and automated checks.
