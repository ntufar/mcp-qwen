# Research Findings: MCP Server for LLM File Browsing

## Technical Decisions

### Language and Framework
**Decision**: Python with FastAPI
**Rationale**: Python has excellent file system handling capabilities and extensive libraries for security and file operations. FastAPI provides high performance, automatic API documentation, and built-in validation.
**Alternatives considered**: Node.js with Express, Rust with Actix, Go with Gin

### Security Implementation
**Decision**: OAuth2 with scopes for access control
**Rationale**: OAuth2 provides a well-established standard for access control that can be integrated with various authentication providers. Scopes allow fine-grained control over file system access.
**Alternatives considered**: JWT tokens, API keys, session-based authentication

### File System Access
**Decision**: Use Python's built-in os and pathlib modules
**Rationale**: These modules provide cross-platform file system access with proper error handling. They are well-tested and part of the standard library.
**Alternatives considered**: Third-party libraries like pyfilesystem, custom implementations

### Data Serialization
**Decision**: JSON for API responses
**Rationale**: JSON is widely supported by LLMs and provides a human-readable format for debugging. FastAPI has built-in support for JSON serialization.
**Alternatives considered**: Protocol Buffers, MessagePack, XML

### Testing Framework
**Decision**: pytest with pytest-cov for coverage
**Rationale**: pytest is the most popular testing framework for Python with extensive plugin support. pytest-cov provides coverage reporting.
**Alternatives considered**: unittest (built-in), nose2

## Performance Considerations

### Caching Strategy
**Decision**: In-memory LRU cache for directory listings
**Rationale**: Directory listings are frequently accessed but don't change rapidly. An LRU cache balances performance with memory usage.
**Alternatives considered**: Redis, file-based caching, no caching

### File Reading Optimization
**Decision**: Stream large files with chunked reading
**Rationale**: Streaming prevents memory issues with large files while maintaining reasonable performance for smaller files.
**Alternatives considered**: Reading entire files into memory, memory-mapped files

## Security Research

### Access Control Patterns
**Decision**: Attribute-based access control (ABAC)
**Rationale**: ABAC provides flexible access control based on user attributes, resource attributes, and environment conditions.
**Alternatives considered**: Role-based access control (RBAC), discretionary access control (DAC)

### Audit Logging
**Decision**: Structured logging with JSON format
**Rationale**: JSON logs are easily parseable by log analysis tools and can include structured data for better querying.
**Alternatives considered**: Plain text logs, syslog, database logging

## Compatibility Research

### Cross-Platform Support
**Decision**: Use pathlib for path operations
**Rationale**: pathlib provides a cross-platform abstraction for file system paths that handles differences between Windows, macOS, and Linux.
**Alternatives considered**: Manual path handling, os.path module

### File Encoding
**Decision**: UTF-8 as default with automatic detection
**Rationale**: UTF-8 is the most common encoding and is supported by most systems. Automatic detection handles legacy files with different encodings.
**Alternatives considered**: Latin-1 as fallback, strict UTF-8 only

## Implementation Constraints

### Memory Usage
**Decision**: Set file reading limits to 10MB
**Rationale**: Balances usability with memory constraints to prevent denial of service from large files.
**Alternatives considered**: No limits, 1MB limit, 100MB limit

### Concurrent Connections
**Decision**: Limit to 100 concurrent connections
**Rationale**: Provides reasonable concurrency while preventing resource exhaustion.
**Alternatives considered**: No limits, 10 concurrent, 1000 concurrent
