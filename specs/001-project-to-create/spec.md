# Feature Specification: MCP Server for LLM File Browsing

**Feature Branch**: `001-project-to-create`  
**Created**: 2025-09-21  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "project to create MCP Server to help LLM to browse local directories and files with examples for real LLMs"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an LLM developer, I want to enable my LLM to securely browse and access local files and directories so that it can provide contextually relevant information from the user's file system when answering questions or performing tasks.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an LLM is connected to the MCP Server and a user requests file information, **When** the LLM sends a file browsing request, **Then** the MCP Server returns the requested file or directory information securely.
2. **Given** a user has configured access permissions, **When** an LLM attempts to access a restricted file, **Then** the MCP Server denies access and logs the attempt.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the requested file or directory doesn't exist?
- How does the system handle file paths that exceed system limits?
- What happens when the file system is unavailable or unresponsive?
- How does the system handle very large files that may exceed memory limits?
- How does the system handle symbolic links or circular references in directories?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow LLMs to list directory contents with appropriate metadata (file names, sizes, types, modification dates).
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow LLMs to read file contents with appropriate size limits.
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide file search capabilities within allowed directories.
- **FR-005**: System MUST support various file formats and encodings.
- **FR-006**: System MUST log all file access attempts for audit purposes.
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages to LLMs.
- **FR-008**: System MUST support configuration of allowed directories and file types.
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide examples and documentation for integrating with real LLMs.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **File**: Represents a file in the file system with attributes like name, path, size, type, and content.
- **Directory**: Represents a directory in the file system with attributes like name, path, and list of contained files/directories.
- **AccessPolicy**: Represents the rules governing which LLMs can access which files/directories.
- **AuditLog**: Represents a record of file access attempts with timestamps, LLM identifiers, and success/failure status.
